<info gid="1163100915" type="Plot Summary">Kagura Takashi has lived with his brother Satoshi since the death of their parents some time ago. Because of that fact, Takashi is able to go to school and lead a normal life. However, he is always compared to his older brother in every thing that he does. Takashi seems to never measure up to what Satoshi has done. The final straw for Takashi was when Satoshi married Miwa, a woman who lived in the same apartment complex they lived in and who Takashi was deeply in love with. Because of that, a deep hatred of his brother rises within Takashi. So with the help of Nagayama Azusa, one of his teachers, Takaski sets out to take what he wants.</info>
