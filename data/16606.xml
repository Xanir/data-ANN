<info type="Plot Summary">Honoka Takamiya is perfectly content with living his quiet life as an average high school junior. The only disruptions to his mundane daily routine all seem to stem from unexpected encounters with his school's super-popular student idol, Ayaka Kagari, the talented, phlegmatic, and gorgeous daughter of the school board chairman. To his dismay, Takamiya's classroom seat turns out to be right next to Kagari-san, thus he suffers jostling, harassment, and even a beating from her inescapable crowd of jealous fans. As if this isn't bad enough, Takamiya's world--as well as a portion of his school--suddenly collapses around him, and he is twice lured into bizarre and fantastic deathtraps. Astonished at his own survival, Takamiya learns that his rescue is thanks to the cool head--and fire power--of a witch... named Ayaka Kagari. From then on, Honoka quickly discovers, with Ayaka's devoted help, that neither his school, nor the people he thought he knew, nor even he himself are in any way normal. &lt;em class=de-emphasized&gt;(from manga)&lt;/em&gt;</info>
